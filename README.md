# 👋 Hi there, I’m María Catalina García Cañas

🎓 I'm a Data Analyst passionate about using Python and SQL to uncover insights and solve real-world problems.  
🚀 Currently diving deeper into scalable data tools like Polars, PyArrow and data modeling techniques.  
🔍 Curious about Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and Cybersecurity — exploring how these areas intersect to build smarter systems.  
📚 I love continuous learning and enjoy documenting my projects with clear explanations, clean code, and reproducible notebooks.

## 🌱 Current Focus
- Migrating classic pandas projects to Polars + PyArrow
- Studying model evaluation techniques (e.g., bias-variance tradeoff, regularization)
- Improving my understanding of cloud & ETL pipelines

## ⚡ Fun fact
I'm a bit clumsy in sports, but I love table tennis 🏓 — I even played in my university’s league!
